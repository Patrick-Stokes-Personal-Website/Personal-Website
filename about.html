            My energetic goofball dog Banjo is my best bud. He is a 2 year old Chocolate Labordor. 
            I got him when he was just an 8 week old puppy. Banjo loves to go on walks and hikes, 
            get his belly rubbed, play fetch with his football, and chase the occasional 
            squirrel that shows up in our backyard.

          <p>
            One of my favorite ways to pass time is by playing video games. There is no better 
            feeling then starting off on an epic adventure to stop a villain or trying to catch 
            em' all. My favorite games come from Nintendo with Mario and Zelda games being some 
            off my all time greats. I also love playing Naughty Dog's grand tells like The Last 
            of Us Part 1 and 2. You can also catch me on the battlefield in EA's BattleField games 
            or in a FromSoftware dungeon.

          <p>
            I take great delight in being active outdoors. I enjoy taking out my bicycle and cycling 
            around town and on trails. Banjo and I adore going to parks and hiking on their trails 
            going deep into the woods. I spend most of my summer hanging out by the pool. I also 
            take joy in playing and watching sports and you'll be able to find me some days at Geodis 
            Park cheering for my local soccer team Nashville SC.
